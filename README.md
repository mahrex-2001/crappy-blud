## Flappy Bird

- Made this OG game using the Unity game engine.
- **Basic prototype**: The current version of the game serves as a foundational starting point. It provides core functionality and mechanics but may lack polish or additional elements.
- **Many modifications and features can be implemented**: There is ample room for improvement and expansion. Possibilities include adding new levels, introducing power-ups or obstacles, enhancing graphics and sound effects, implementing multiplayer functionality, refining controls, and much more.



BTW, Sometimes you gotta spend some time traveling!
